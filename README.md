drush-m2c
=========

Converter from a Drush makefile to composer.json

Usage
-----

This is just a Drush script: not a Drush command (although it could be converted into one fairly easily.)

    $ drush php-script path/to/drush-m2c/make_to_composer.drush path/to/makefile.make > path/to/composer.json

It's very much in alpha and you should only use it at your own risk.
